        <p>I have been working with JavaScript since I was 12. Over that time period, I have become very experienced with the <a href='https://threejs.org/'>Three.js</a> and <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API'>WebGL</a> APIs. I have experience with other languages such as C++, C#, Lua, Java, and Python.</p>

        <p>I have buiild my own game engine from scratch for my games. I decided to call it the <a href='https://github.com/lotech-studios/dimensional-engine'>Dimensional Engine</a>. My engine is Entity Component System based uses <a href='https://threejs.org/'>Three.js</a> for easy 3D development. The thing I am most proud of is my super-performant Rendering Pipeline. You can download the latest stable release of my engine <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/dimensional-engine'>here</a> (NPM).</p>
